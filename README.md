sciDX API is a RESTful API built with FastAPI. It is one of the components of the sciDX stack, which provides comprehensive solutions for managing and accessing scientific data. This API facilitates the management of datasets, metadata, and integration with various data sources like Object Stores, URLs, and Kafka streams.

As part of a team of scientists managing large volumes of experimental data, you can use the sciDX API to efficiently handle these data by linking them to a CKAN instance. Subsequently, once the data is registered in our system, you can work with them using the functionalities provided by the endpoints. This facilitates the efficient organization and manipulation of extensive scientific data collections.

Please note that this API is a work in progress, with a new release scheduled every month until our goals are achieved.
